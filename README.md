> what is the main purpose?

Take 50 molecules in isolation (.csv) and perform a conformational search using CHEAPOCREST. After the conformational search, we optimize the best confomers (crest_best.xyz) using DFT. After optimizing the initial models (the 50 molecules), we will permutatively put them together to form the EDA (electron donnor-acceptor) complexes.

P.S.: We are using CREST instead of cheapocrest
